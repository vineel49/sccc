# Iterative decoding of serially concatenated convolutional codes using the logBCJR algorithm



Generator matrix for both the encoders is G(D) = [1 (1+D^2)/(1+D+D^2)]. 

The log BCJR matlab code is inspired by the scilab code of BCJR algorithm in probability domain written by K Vasudevan and can be found at http://home.iitk.ac.in/~vasu.
